# Introduction

This git repository contains embedded firmware project which provides LoRaWAN
FUOTA (Firmware Update Over The Air) functionality using Actility FUOTA service.  
Device code supports full firmware update and Smart Delta incremental update.  
Device code currently supports only NUCLEO-L476RG hardware platform but could be
ported to other compatible platforms. Only EU868, US916 and AS923 ISM bands are
supported. This is limitation of the FUOTA service. Support of the other bands
will be introduced later.  
This device code is based on the ST “LoRaWAN software expansion for STM32Cube”
v1.3.1, available
[here](https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/i-cube-lrwan.html).

# New features, improvements and limitations 

This device code contains following new features, improvements and limitations,
comparing to ST’s LoRaWAN software expansion v1.3.1:

*New features*

-   **Smart Delta incremental firmware update.** Smart Delta is an intelligent
    type of firmware upgrade compression which allows to transfer during the
    upgrade session only changed pieces of device code. It does not require any
    special preparation and planning of firmware image comparing for example
    with partial update functionality when only contiguous specially crafted
    regions of device firmware could be upgraded.

-   **LoRaWAN Firmware Management Protocol support.** Implementation of the
    LoRaWAN Firmware Management Protocol Specification Release Candidate 2.
    Required for device to be compatible with Actility FUOTA service.

-   **Storage of received data fragments directly in the MCU flash.** ST’s
    implementation of Fragmented Data Block Transport over LoRaWAN **in**
    LoRaWAN software expansion v1.3.1 supports storage of data fragments only in
    RAM. It leads to ineffective use of RAM and limits the maximum size of
    firmware update by very low number. Device code in the project implements
    direct storage of the data fragments in the MCU flash.

*Bug fixed*

-   **Fragmentation decoder bug fixes**. Bug related to more than required
    number of fragments received and incorrect work with single fragment file.

-   **Device time update bug fixes**. If network and application server both
    supports time synchronization device code operated incorrectly.

*Limitations*

-   **STM original default project configuration not supported**. Not tested.

-   **Only STM32CubeIDE project is currently supported**. Keil, IAR project
    configuration will be supported later.

# Hardware and software requirements

*Board requirements*

Currently device code only supports STM32L476RG CPU and SX1272 Semtech LoRaWAN
transceiver. List of supported platforms will be extended in the future.

In order to run device code, get and assemble following parts together:

-   **[ST MCU development board NUCLEO-L476RG](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-l476rg.html).**
    

-   **[Semtech LoRa shield SX1272MB2DAS](https://www.semtech.com/products/wireless-rf/lora-transceivers/sx1272mb2das).**
    

*MCU flash requirements*

Device code implementation currently requires 3 equally sized flash regions to
support firmware update. These regions are:

-   **SLOT0** – active firmware image slot

-   **SLOT1** – new firmware image slot. SBSFU bootloader will check presence of
    new firmware in this slot and if it is valid will install it in SLOT0

-   **SWAP** – area which is used to received data fragments during
    fragmentation session and for swapping SLOT1 and SLOT0 contents during image
    installation and rollback (if installation fails). Its size should be set
    depending on either full image update supported or not. If full image update
    is supported it should be set equal to SLOT0 and SLOT1. If full image update
    is not supported its size could be set to largest supported incremental
    update size.

Default configuration of device code sets size of each region to 303K. For more
details about memory mapping planning see “Appendix B. Porting”.

*Fragmentation algorithm RAM overhead calculation*

Memory overhead of the fragmentation algorithm support and Smart Delta library
support could be calculated as following.

The amount of memory required for the algorithm depends on:

-   Number of fragments required for a full file (without the redundancy
    packets) (nbFrag). Default configuration nbFrag = 1000.

-   The size of a data fragment (fragSize). Default configuration fragSize =
    230.

-   The maximum number of redundancy frames that are expected (nbRedundancy).
    Default configuration nbRedundancy = 60.

Memory required can be calculated via:

(nbRedundancy / 8 + 1) \* nbRedundancy -\> MatrixM2B

\+ nbFrag \* 2 -\> FragNbMissingIndex

\+ nbFrag / 8 + 1 -\> matrixRow

\+ fragSize -\> matrixDataTemp

\+ (nbRedundancy / 8 + 1) \* 3 -\> dataTempVector, dataTempVector2 and S

For a default configuration this comes down to \~2 444 bytes of RAM.

In addition, some small allocations are made when xor'ing lines while applying
the redundant packets.

*Smart Delta library flash and RAM requirements*

Smart Delta library requires approximately 4K of MCU flash and 2,3K of RAM.

*Network requirements and implementation limitations*

In order to support FUOTA LoRaWAN network should support following features:

-   LoRaWAN multicast support

-   Time synchronization. Either support of MAC level DeviceTimeReq/Ans commands
    or support of application-level time synchronization. Actility FUOTA Service
    supports application-level time synchronization.

Current device code does not support Class B multicast session. This limitation
will be lifted in the future.

*Device credentials configuration*

In order to customize the `devEUI`/`JoinEUI`/`AppKey`/`GenAppKey` device parameters use
following procedure:

-    Edit
`<root_dir>\Projects\STM32L476RG-Nucleo\Applications\LoRaWAN_Fuota1\Fuota\LoRaWAN\App\inc\Commissioning.h`

-   Customize these parameters: `LORAWAN_DEVICE_EUI`, `LORAWAN_JOIN_EUI`,
    `LORAWAN_APP_KEY`, `LORAWAN_GEN_APP_KEY`

*Fragmentation decoder configuration*

Fragmentation decoder configuration should be adjusted if you want to adapt
maximum size of firmware received for data rates you plan to use in specific RF
region. Refer to regional parameters LoRaWAN document to obtain maximum size of
the frame (data fragment size will be size of frame minus MAC header) in
selected RF regions with given data rates. Maximum data fragment size multiplied
by maximum number of fragments will define largest size of firmware image to be
received.

Adapt maximum number of redundancy fragments according to expected maximum
packet loss in the network and maximum number of the fragments expected.
Typically, it will be required to receive a little bit more redundancy packets
(from 2 to 10) than were lost to recover initial data file.

See “Fragmentation algorithm RAM overhead calculation” to calculate required RAM
size with selected fragmentation decoder configuration.

To customize fragmentation decoder parameters:

-   Edit
    `<root_dir>\Middlewares\Third_Party\LoRaWAN\Patterns\Advanced\LmHandler\packages\FragDecoder.h`

| **Symbol**          | **Description**                                     | **Setting**                    |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| FRAG_MAX_NB         | Maximum number of fragments which could be received | Default setting 1000 fragments |
| FRAG_MAX_SIZE       | Maximum fragment size                               | Default setting 230 bytes      |
| FRAG_MAX_REDUNDANCY | Maximum number of redundancy fragments              | Default setting 60 fragments   |

# Flashing firmware and first start

In order to flash compiled binary into device use following procedure:

-   Install STM32Cube Programmer 2.8.0:
    <https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html>

-   Start STM32Cube Programmer

    -   Click on `Open file` and select
        `<root_dir>\Projects\STM32L476RG-Nucleo\Applications\LoRaWAN_Fuota1\Fuota\Binary\SBSFU_UserApp.bin`

        -   Click `Download`. At this point, the firmware is loaded onto the
            device

        -   Click `Disconnect`

In order to verify that device correctly operates after flashing you will need
to connect to the device virtual COM port. You should do it before flashing. On 
Windows, to obtain COM port number:

-   Press Win+X and select “Device manager”

-   In the section “Ports (COM and LPT)” look for COM port with description
    “STLink Virtual COM Port” and note its number in parenthesis, e.g. COM8.

-   Run your favorite terminal emulator, e.g. TeraTerm, and connect to serial
    port you obtain above (COM8) with following parameters: speed 921600, data
    bits 8, stop bits 1, parity NONE.

-   Check that device boots up correctly and you can see the following output in
    the terminal emulator window

# Using firmware with FUOTA server

In order test firmware update you first will need to configure full firmware
update campaign. Please, refer to ThingPark FUOTA documentation available [here](https://www.actility.com/thingpark-documentation-portal/).  
During the campaign creation you will be asked for firmware file to download.
Use
`<root_dir>\Projects\STM32L476RG-Nucleo\Applications\LoRaWAN_Fuota1\Fuota\Binary\UserApp.sfb`
in this case.

To created Smart Delta update binary, you will need to specify two files of
different firmware versions. Use following procedure to create necessary
binaries:

-   Build and load firmware image into the device as described in “Flashing
    firmware and first start”.

-   Use
    `<root_dir>\Projects\STM32L476RG-Nucleo\Applications\LoRaWAN_Fuota1\Fuota\Binary\UserApp.sfb`
    to create “from” file as described in Section 3.13 of the User Guide.   
    During a file creation use application version specified in
    `<root_dir>\Projects\STM32L476RG-Nucleo\Applications\LoRaWAN_Fuota1\Fuota\LoRaWAN\App\inc\version.h`
    when asked.

-   Change something in device source code and update version in version.h file.
    It is recommended to update just `__APP_VERSION_SUB2` symbol. Increment it by
    one for example.

-   Build new firmware image. Use UserApp.sfb from this build to create “to”
    file in GUI. Use updated version number when asked.

-   Create Smart Delta patch as described in Section 3.14 of the User Guide. You
    will use this Smart Delta binary when configuring new Campaign.

-   Run firmware update campaign and verify that device firmware was indeed
    updated using APP_VERSION information in the device boot screen.

# Appendixes

# Appendix A. Smart Delta library operation and API description

## Smart Delta core overview

Patching core is written in attempt to be system-independent, although taking in
account the usage at devices with restricted resources. Smart Delta creation
core functions require significantly more resources and targeted to regular
computers.

User of Smart Delta core must provide patch image to core functions and store
result of patching in system-depended manner.

The data in a patch image is presented as a stream which may be processed in one
pass. There is a header with metadata at the beginning of patch image describing
a kind of the image and containing parameters required to apply patch.

There are 2 basic functions to apply patch. First the patching must be
initialized by calling fota_patch_stream_init(...). Then one should call
fota_patch_stream_append(...) sequentially for every byte in a patch stream.

The result of patching is returned in callback function fota_write_target(...).
As patching core is supplied in sources this callback is ‘statically registered’
– user must provide it in his sources. The callback provides resulting image by
1 byte per call and user must store these bytes to collect whole new image.

There may be any number of calls to fota_write_target(...) inside 1 call to
fota_patch_stream_append(...) – from 0 to new image size.

After initialization must be called sequentially for bytes of patch image data
(which are at offset returned in \*ppatch_header_size from patch image start).
New image is ready when all bytes consumed.

Arguments:

| Argument                           | Description                                                                                     |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| fota_patch_stream_state_t *pstream | Patching process context. It is used internally and must persist during whole patching process. |
| uint8_t byte                       | Next byte of patch image data                                                                   |

Return values:

| Value                                    | Description                                                   |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|

| fotaLzgMiss                              | Decompression failure, abort patching (patch image corrupted) |
| fotaBspatchOrigMiss                      | Patching failure, abort patching (patch image corrupted)      |
| fotaTargetOverflow fotaTargetWriteFailed | Translated from fota_write_target(...), abort patching        |

##### 

*Storing result*

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
fota_patch_result_t fota_write_target(
uint8_t b
);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

User supplied callback to store new image. Called 0 or more times inside
fota_patch_stream_append(...), sequentially provides bytes of new image.
Depending on FLASH requirements it may write supplied byte directly to output
area or collect writable page in intermediate buffer.

Arguments:

| Argument     | Description                      |
|--------------|----------------------------------|
| uint8_t byte | Next byte of (patched) new image |

Return values:

| Value                 | Description                                                                           |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| fotaOk                | Success (byte stored)                                                                 |
| fotaTargetOverflow    | New image area overflowed, patching impossible                                        |
| fotaTargetWriteFailed | Byte write error, patching must be aborted (retries not implemented in patching core) |
